# VPC Peering

Lab Objective 

1. Setup lab vpc
2. Create VPC peering within Default VPC and Lab VPC
3. Setup appropriate route table
4. Create bastion host in public subnet - Default VPC
5. Create Main host in private subnet - Lab VPC use ALL ICMP allow SG from Default VPC.
6. Login to Bastion host and Ping to Main host private IP

## Step 1 : Create VPC

There is a default VPC in us-east-1 region where the default VPC is vpc-012cc4199aa605f78 and we will use 172.31.32.0/20 public subnet.

We now create the Lab VPC with 1 private subnet without [NAT Gateway].

## Step 2 : Create VPC Peering Connection

Request VPC = Default VPC 

Accepter VPC = LAB VPC 

We will accept the request in order to establish VPC Peering Connection.

The VPC Peering connection status is now ‚ÄúActive‚Äù

## Step 3 : Modifying Route Table

Although VPC Peering has been set up, we need to modify route table in order to establish the connection between two VPCs.

## Step 4 : Launch Bastion Host in Default VPC

Create the security group for bastion host and allow SSH and ICMP Traffic.

![image.png](image%208.png)

Launch Bastion host in default VPC. 

![image.png](image%209.png)

The IP Addresses for bastion host are 

Public IP = 98.82.33.209

Private IP = 172.31.38.94

## Step 5 : Launch Main Host in LAB VPC

Create the security group for main host and allow SSH and ICMP Traffic.

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Launch the main host in LAB VPC with private subnet.

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Private IP Address = 10.2.1.131

## Step 6 : Log-in to the Bastion Host and test the connectivity

We now log-in to the Bastion Host and ping 10.2.1.131 which is IP Address of main host.

```reason
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-38-94 ~]$ ping 10.2.1.131 -c 10
PING 10.2.1.131 (10.2.1.131) 56(84) bytes of data.

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-38-94 ~]$ 
```

If we delete the following rule from the route table of LAB VPC, we will see we cannot ping anymore from the bastion host to main host. 

Deleted Route ‚áí Destination, 172.31.0.0/16, Target = pcx-id

```reason
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-38-94 ~]$ ping 10.2.1.131 -c 10
PING 10.2.1.131 (10.2.1.131) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 10.2.1.131 ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 9339ms
```

Last but not least, we delete the resources that we create for this lab.
